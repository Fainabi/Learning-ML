# Learning for ML
I start this for practicing training modules of machine learning and as
a note of what I've learnt in the courses([Stanford CS229: Machine Learning (Autumn 2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)) on youtube.

## Content
The files follow the order of the courses with slight changes. Variables' name are chosen as
what they look like in theory as possible, which means most of them consist of Greek alphabeta and
some subscripts encoded in unicode. In the julia REPL, just type the LaTeX-like abbreviations and enter
Tab to let julia print the characters, which looks like:

```julia-repl
julia> \pi
```
and with Tab entered
```julia-repl
julia> π
π = 3.1415926535897...

julia>
```

Some IDE for julia and extensions also support this.
